# QuadCode

Welcome to the CE-222 Simulator GitHub repository! This simulator is designed to emulate a 4-bit opcode processor, providing a hands-on learning experience for understanding the fundamentals of processor operations. The codebase is developed using Python's Tkinter library to create a graphical user interface (GUI) for ease of use.

# Introduction
The CE-222 Simulator is an educational tool aimed at students and enthusiasts who wish to learn about processor architecture and instruction sets. The simulator supports a 4-bit opcode processor, allowing users to load programs, execute instructions, and observe the processor's behavior through a user-friendly GUI.

# Features
Graphical User Interface: Intuitive and easy-to-use interface built with Tkinter.
4-bit Opcode Support: Simulates a processor that uses 4-bit opcodes.
Instruction Execution: Load and execute custom programs.
Real-time Visualization: View the state of the processor, registers, and memory in real-time.
